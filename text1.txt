OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT:

  JAVASCRIPT OBJECT:
    A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). An object method is an 
    object property containing a function definition.

 Object:
    An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a 
    pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. 
    The variables don’t actually store the value.

 Object in javascript:
    objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types,
     in the form of “key: value” pairs.

 Properties and methods of objects:
  keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of 
  an object.

 Objects and properties:
   A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that 
   is attached to the object.
